## Abstract

The idea is simple. A single smart contract, that manages vault creation, top-up, and renewal. The vault owner can add a list of ENS names to the vault, and anyone can renew the names. The vault owner can top-up the vault with ETH, and the renewer can utilize the ETH for renewing the names. Part of the renewal fee is shared with the renewer, as such to incentivize the renewer to renew the names.
